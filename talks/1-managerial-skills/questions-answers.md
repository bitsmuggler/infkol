good hard skills are a requirement in IT
but good soft skills makes the life easier

## Eisenhower

Eisenhower matrix: two dimensions: urgency (x) and importance (y)

          +         urgency        -
            |----------|-----------|
          i |          |           |
          m |          |           |
          p |  me now  | task list |
          o |          |           |
          r |          |           |
          t |----------|-----------|
          a |          |           |
          n |          |           |
          c | delegate |   trash   |
          e |          |           |
            |          |           |
          - |----------|-----------|
           
urgent and important: "me now" YOU have to do it (manager, employee, privately...)
not urgent and not important: "trash", just discard
not urgent but important: "task list", need to plan
    tends to move to "me now" as time goes
    might also go to the "trash" once in a while
urgent but not important: "delegate"
    normal work, but must be started now in order to get finished
    delegate to subordinate
    to which one?
    must be feasible for the person to do according to his workload
manager decides in the area "task list"/"delegate"
    successful manager can handle those fields accordingly

## Pyramids

Pyramid I, just a plain fucking pyramid
Pyramid II, hierarchy: hierarchical barriers
Pyramid III, function: functional barriers
Pyramid IV: functional and hierarchy barriers: isolated knowledge islands

## 3 Ways

1. Boss: Command, Control, Correct
    - most experienced subordinate will perform less, slow down, find obstacles
    - some will just deliver what is requested, nothing more
2. Friend:
    - a friend is often not a person of authority, but on the same level
3. hard work + earn trust
4. laissez faire

the transition to the second management position (higher) will be less hard than the initial one
learned how to do it already


# Q & A

1. How can you tell when you are facing ordinary adjustment problems and when
   it is your actual wrong-doing?
    - error != wrong-doing
    - have to step out of your engineering role/skills
    - need to trust subordinates
    - more management skills (schedule, plan, negotiation) needed
    - have to decide, always will make mistakes
2. Aren't these adjustment problems a neccessity to prepare you as a manager
   for worse situations?
    - only few companies help
    - starting to early could be kontraproduktiv
    - "traumatic" first year is not well-known, companies are not aware of the issue
3. What are some of these problems that almost always occur when transitioning
   to a first manager position?
    - see above
4. Will becoming a manager stay equally hard when many companies are themselves
   transitioning from hierarchical to more flat organizations?
    - always measured by success
    - changing the role from engineer to management position is always difficult
    - also "agile" companies need managers
    - Nelson Mandela: plan for underground activity was a hierarchical plan
    - a sort of hierarchy is always needed
5. Aren't there also situations where neglecting all forms of authority in
   order to build better relationships with subordinates become a problem in
   itself?
    - make something up
