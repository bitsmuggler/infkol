# Summary

In her article _Becoming the Boss_ (Hill, 2018), the author describes the
struggles first-time managers face. Succeeding as a manager requires a
different skill set than succeeding as a individual. New managers first need to
understand the nature of their new role, which usually happens in a "learning
by doing" or even "try and fail" process. New managers are often thrown into
their first management position without support from their superiours -- even
though they used to be former first-time managers, too, and know the struggles
a first-time manager is facing.

Authority does not come with the position, but must be earned. Especially
talented subordinates do not just follow orders blindly, but question their new
boss and scrutinize him for hidden motives. A manager focusing on technical
problems could become a micromanager and a "control freak". Showing off
technical skills can even undermine a manager's credibility. The manager's role
is not about solving technical problems, but about managing interdependencies.

Managing a team is not the same as managing a bunch of individuals: Every
decision concerning a team member affects the team as a whole. Granting
privileges on a single team member can have a negative impact on the team as a
whole, for every other team member feels worse off without those privileges. A
manager should focus instead on shaping team culture, which can unleash the
team's problem-solving prowess.

A common misconception is that the boss is supposed to have all the answers.
New managers often tend to avoid questions, because they are afraid to look
"dumb" in front of their superiours or subordinates. Asking questions can help
to clarify open points, and ensures that both parties involved talk about the
same thing. Once clarity about an issue is established, nobody can try to sneak
out under the pretense that he or she understood it differently.  A new
manager's success is not only important for a single team, but for the
organization as a whole.

# Questions

1. How can you tell when you are facing ordinary adjustment problems and when
   it is your actual wrong-doing? What are key indicators?
2. Aren't these adjustment problems a neccessity to prepare you as a manager
   for worse situations?
3. What are some of these problems that almost always occur when transitioning
   to a first manager position?
4. Will becoming a manager stay equally hard when many companies are themselves
   transitioning from hierarchical to more flat organizations?
5. Aren't there also situations where neglecting all forms of authority in
   order to build better relationships with subordinates become a problem in
   itself?
