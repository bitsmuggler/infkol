# Summary

In Linda A. Hill's article *Becoming the Boss* (Hill, 2018), she describes the struggles first-time managers face. Succeeding as a manager requires a different skill set than succeeding as an individual. New managers first need to understand the nature of their new role, which usually happens in a "learning by doing" or even "try and fail" process. New managers are often thrown into their first management position without support from their superiours â€” even though they used to be former first-time managers, too, and know the struggles a first-time manager is facing.

Rainer Schaub agrees with Hill and explains that often times the difficulties start with small things such as balancing tasks. It is often times a task in itself, when trying to figure when to do a task yourself, when to prioritise it, when to delegate it and when to discard it alltogether. As a help he indicated to the Eisenhower matrix and showed examples of how to assign a subordinate when a task needs delegating    [maybe add example?]    

Another important problem is Authority. Authority does not come with the position, but must be earned. Especially talented subordinates do not just follow orders blindly, but question their new boss and scrutinize him for hidden motives. A manager focusing on technical problems could become a micromanager and a "control freak". Showing off
technical skills can even undermine a manager's credibility. The manager's role is not about solving technical problems, but about managing interdependencies. (Hill, 2018) Rainer Schaub summed the above examples into three fundamentals ways of approaches to getting respect and authority from your subordinates:

1. By being a boss: Command, Control, Correct
   * most experienced subordinate will perform less, slow down, find obstacles
   * some will just deliver what is requested, nothing more
   * some will find ways to achieve fast results (loss in quality)
2. By being a friend
   * a friend is often not a person of authority, but on the same level
   * a friend might take advantage of his position which can lead to "weird" situations
3. Hard work + earn trust
   * by showing your team that you work hard, you put yourself in their shoes and on their level
   * your team sees that you don't just delegate, but you actually understand what is going on and therefore will most likely trust you more

(Schraub, 2019)

Managing a team is not the same as managing a bunch of individuals: Every
decision concerning a team member affects the team as a whole. Granting
privileges on a single team member can have a negative impact on the team as a
whole, for every other team member feels worse off without those privileges. A
manager should focus instead on shaping team culture, which can unleash the
team's problem-solving prowess.

A common misconception is that the boss is supposed to have all the answers.
New managers often tend to avoid questions, because they are afraid to look
"dumb" in front of their superiours or subordinates. Asking questions can help
to clarify open points, and ensures that both parties involved talk about the
same thing. Once clarity about an issue is established, nobody can try to sneak
out under the pretense that he or she understood it differently.  A new
manager's success is not only important for a single team, but for the
organization as a whole. (Hill, 2019)

Schraub noted that making mistakes isn't the worst thing. What is way more important is that you make decisions and in retrospective learn from your mistakes. (Schraub, 2019)

# Questions

1. How can you tell when you are facing ordinary adjustment problems and when
   it is your actual wrong-doing?
2. Aren't these adjustment problems a neccessity to prepare you as a manager
   for worse situations?
3. What are some of these problems that almost always occur when transitioning
   to a first manager position?
4. Will becoming a manager stay equally hard when many companies are themselves
   transitioning from hierarchical to more flat organizations?
5. Aren't there also situations where neglecting all forms of authority in
   order to build better relationships with subordinates become a problem in
   itself?
